# PaintBar

Welcome to Paintbar! :paintbar: 

We're glad you're here! Paintbar is a brand new tool that is targeting anyone who wants to draw with a simple, free, interface. This project has started off as a free time experiment but I think it will be excellent through the roof.

Paintbar is also an interface to the world of Web3 and NFTs. 

When the product is ready for it's first major version it will support the following features:

A full set of drawing tools
A dedicated user profile
The ability to save, name, and edit projects to your profile
The ability to publish projects to a community gallery in the Paintbar Gallery
The ability sell your art as an NFT on the Hedera / Hiero-Ledger network
The ability to browse all NFTs minted through Paintbar on the Paintbar Browser

For now explore the feature-set that is available today:
